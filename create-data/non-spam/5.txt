Good afternoon,

This morning you recieved an email about adding questions for your course SET. This email was sent by mistake. It has come to my attention that MEDS courses do not use SET evaluations and should not have been included in the process.

If you teach non-MEDS courses, you may still add questions to those evaluation through the previous email.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you, and I am sorry for the confusion,
