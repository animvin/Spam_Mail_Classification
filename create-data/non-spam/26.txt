Dear new international students: 

All new international students who have begun programs in Fall 2017 will need to complete a Form called the Substitute W-9S and submit it to the UConn Bursar office in Storrs. Please find instructions for completing and submitting the form below. 

Instructions to complete, and link to Substitute Form W-9S:

Part I: Fill in your name, address, and Net ID or PeopleSoft Number. If you have a U.S. Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), also fill this in. 
If you have NO U.S. SSN or ITIN at this time, but you will apply for one because you currently have either:
- An on-campus job offer, including Graduate Assistantship
- A scholarship from a U.S. funding source (for example, a UConn athletic scholarship)
wait to submit this form until after you have received your SSN or ITIN and fill out parts I and II above. 


Part II: Sign and date the form, if you filled in your U.S. SSN or ITIN.  If you do not have a U.S. SSN or ITIN, skip to next section.

Part III:  If you do not have a U.S. SSN or taxpayer ID, and you do not have an on-campus job or scholarship from a U.S. source, then complete part III of the form, checking the box that indicates you  are a foreign national and do not have a SSN or ITIN. Sign and date the form and submit to the UConn Bursar office in person, by mail or by fax. 

Visiting scholars and foreign nationals who are not enrolled in classes do not need to complete this form. 

Where to submit: 

In person: UConn Office of the Bursar, Wilbur Cross Building, UConn Storrs Campus.
