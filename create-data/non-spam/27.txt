Dear students,
Based on questions that ISSS has received, I would like to provide a few clarifications regarding yesterdayâ€™s announcement:

1. At this time, the form should be completed by new enrolled students who have not studied at UConn in the past. Students who began new programs this fall, but were enrolled previously in UConn programs, have most likely already completed the requirements of this form, and do not have to submit it at this time.

2. For students with a U.S.-source scholarship income: If your scholarship covers living expenses, it is considered taxable income and you will apply for either an ITIN (no other employment) or an SSN (if you have employment). You should fill out Part II of the form and submit to the Bursar after obtaining your ITIN or SSN. 
If you have a U.S. source scholarship (including a scholarship from UConn) that covers your tuition, you are not required to apply for an ITIN/SSN and you should continue to Part III (unless you have a job and will apply for an SSN). Graduate Assistantships are considered employment, not scholarships.

Thank you.
