Good evening everyone,

This will be the final reminder regarding the GSS Thanksgiving Luncheon. We do have a limited number of spots open so if you haven't already, please RSVP NOW to claim your spot. Registration for this event will close tomorrow morning to give us time to prepare for sign-in.

The lunch will be served in the Rome Commons Ballroom on Wednesday, November 15th (that's tomorrow). Unfortunately, we will not be able to accommodate non-UConn graduate student guests for this event so your student ID will be required for entry. See you there and have a great rest of the pre-break week! 


Sincerely,
Chau
