Then you definitely need to take the Advanced Topics in Project Management - Agile course. 
This is a must for anyone who desires a career as a project manager.
Agile - the bleeding edge methodology for developing new software or new products. Born from Lean or the Toyota Production System, the Agile style or pseudo Agile is making its presence known in more and more US companies doing traditional design or those evolving to a digital transformation. Agile players run fast and sure.
This course will cover the history of Agile, the Agile Manifesto, Sub styles of Agile including Scrum, Kan Ban and Extreme Programming (XP). We will drill down our project requirements to User Stories, and Story Estimation techniques, and the 4 Rituals of a Sprint. You will gain your Agile fluency by action. Class teams will pick a failed project, and retrofit it in Agile during the duration of the course. We will live our life on the "bleeding edge" by practicing  our Agile efforts on Jira (Atlassian) software and Sprint games.
