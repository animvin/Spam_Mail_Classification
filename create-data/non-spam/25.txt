Hello Graduate Business Students, 
 
During the lunch hour tomorrow and Thursday, Chris Dudanowicz, Event Coordinator for Upward Hartford is offering tours to those who would like to check out the hottest spot for innovation in Hartford. 
 
We will gather outside of Room 602 and head over to 20 Church St. to quickly tour the facility (still in development) and hear about the exciting things planned for the space, as well as ways for you to get involved. Below are some examples. 
 
Please find attached the latest version of the Hackathon flyer and consider yourself invited. The student discount of 50% off the weekend is available until September 4th.
 
This is the Eventbrite link, and the website (www.hartfordhack.com) has all the info and links as well. 
 
I hope to see you all there, 
Ian
