Hello BDM students:

Hope you're looking forward to our Business Decision Modeling class starting in October - mid-November.  
Going over my class rosters, I noticed that there are about 60 students in the evening-Sat section, but less than 20 in the morning-Thur section.  I would like to advise you that with smaller class sizes, there is more room to have personal interactions, and a more relaxed atmosphere, so, if your schedule allows, you still have time to switch to the morning section in BDM.  The morning section meets on the same Tuesdays, but 9:30AM-12:30PM and two full Thursdays instead of the whole-day Saturdays.
Whatever section you decide to enroll, I'll see you in one month; early or late!Enjoy the start of the academic year and best greetings,

Jan Stallaert
